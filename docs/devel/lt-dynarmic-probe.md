# Asset-free Dynarmic/QEMU bridge experiment

This default-off, unqualified diagnostic is not a product CPU backend or a
performance optimization. The first Linux/x86-64 build and synthetic
differential proof passed in the narrow scope recorded below.

The empty `lt_dynarmic_probe_prefix` Meson option preserves existing builds.
An explicit dependency prefix compiles two experimental ARM source files and
an internal execution-loop hook. An additionally required environment variable
`LT_DYNARMIC_PROBE=1` enables eligibility. The experiment requires `-M none`,
ARM1176, one CPU, little-endian ARM user mode, GDB single-step, single-threaded
TCG, no instruction counting, no replay and no plugins. At most eight eligible
instructions execute. All real device boards always use ordinary TCG.

Only `MOV r0,#imm8` and `ADD r0,r0,#imm8`, with unconditional AL and no flag
updates, are whitelisted. QEMU first checks actual instruction-fetch MMU
permissions and resolves a RAM region. The C wrapper copies the live integer
registers and reconstructed CPSR to a C++ bridge. That bridge creates a fresh
8 MiB ARMv6K Dynarmic JIT, steps the one actual instruction and verifies all
sixteen resulting registers and unchanged CPSR before committing any QEMU
state. It emits an exact stderr execution witness. Any unsupported outcome
leaves the live QEMU state unchanged and continues through TCG.

No QEMU state, MMU helper or nonlocal-exit path enters an active C++ frame.
Loads, stores, CP15, SVC, privileged execution, Thumb and other instructions
remain ordinary TCG. Faulting instruction fetch falls back to TCG for genuine
exception delivery. A fresh alternate JIT context on every instruction avoids
pretending that cross-engine code-cache invalidation has been implemented.
VFP is unchanged because neither eligible instruction accesses it.

A dependency prefix must contain `include/dynarmic` and a shared library in
`lib` or `lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`; runtime dependencies must be supplied separately.
No automatic download, system installation or library vendoring is performed.
The `lt-dynarmic-probe` device configuration selects no iOS boards and needs no
firmware. A future bounded build can pass
`-Dlt_dynarmic_probe_prefix=/absolute/dependency/usr` to Meson and
`--with-devices-arm=lt-dynarmic-probe` to configure, with plugins disabled.

The LightTouch `tools/arm1176-mmu-reference.py` differential harness must run
the same legal input first on the existing reference engine, then with
`--require-dynarmic-probe` on the experimental engine. Besides identical
integer/MMU/fault states it requires two actual execution witnesses, so a
stock engine passing only the TCG state assertions cannot qualify the bridge.
The control proof already established real ARM1176 readable-load, data-abort
and prefetch-abort state; preserve its original failed XN assumption separately.

This experiment does not qualify the board-only PL0 CP15 QEMU_CALL/GLES bridge,
an alternate data-memory adapter, persistent cache identity/invalidation,
Android/AArch64 deployment, iOS execution, free-running interrupts/lifecycle or
any speedup. The fresh-JIT, single-step path is unsuitable for benchmarking.

## Actual first proof

Engine source `653c948ab2` built with an independently pinned Ubuntu Dynarmic
6.5 shared library. The same executable with the switch OFF and ON produced
identical complete sixteen-register/CPSR observations in eight cases: actual
CP15 MMU bootstrap, two integer instructions, readable load, permission and
translation data aborts, current pre-v7 ignored-XN behavior and an unmapped
instruction-fetch prefetch abort. ON emitted the two required execution
witnesses; OFF emitted none. A stock-engine negative passed the same state
assertions but correctly failed the required execution witnesses.

The proof used only legal synthetic RAM with no iOS assets or device model.
Data loads and all architectural faults executed through TCG. The observation
does not establish a Dynarmic data-MMU adapter, board CP15/GLES behavior,
interrupt/lifecycle correctness, Android/AArch64 support or a speedup.

Retain the exact build/source/library hashes and failed configuration/compile
attempts with the private integration receipt. Build attempt01 lacked the
target-required FDT dependency; attempt02 exposed a target-poisoning error in
the generic execution loop. The tested correction routes the experiment
through a default-off internal TCGCPUOps callback, assigned only by ARM.

## Prepared RAM-read and bounded-capsule extension (UNBUILT / UNRUN)

The next source revision expands the single-step diagnostic with aligned
`LDR Rd,[Rn,#imm12]` using positive, preindexed, non-writeback word addressing.
Both registers must be r0-r12. QEMU checks actual EL0 data-load translation
and permissions in C and resolves an ordinary RAM region before creating the
JIT. A misaligned address, permission/translation failure, unassigned physical
address, RAM-device region or other non-RAM region rejects the alternate path.
TCG sees the original instruction and all original architectural state and
performs the real access/fault. No MMIO callback is invoked speculatively.

The C++ callback can read only the one prepared virtual address and value,
exactly once, at the approved width. It cannot call QEMU or read live host RAM.
Any other read, write, exception, SVC or fallback rejects the complete capsule.
A successful actual JIT step must return `HaltReason::Step` and match all
sixteen expected registers and the entire reconstructed CPSR before commit.
Live QEMU breakpoints/watchpoints conservatively disable this diagnostic.

The same source prepares ordinary r0-r12 MOV/ADD/SUB/AND/EOR/ORR with unrotated
imm8, CMP with unrotated imm8, and B/BEQ/BNE with immediate displacement. Only
CMP changes flags. A snapshot capsule/planner can represent up to eight
ALU/branch/read steps and verifies actual intermediate states. It has no
writes, indirect branches, PC operands, stack/link-register operands, VFP,
Thumb, CP15 or privileged instructions. A failed prospective instruction ends
the safe prefix; a future caller must return its final state to normal QEMU
for precise unsupported/fault handling. Fresh JIT state is used per capsule.

**The execution-loop caller still supplies budget=1 and still requires GDB
single-step. No multi-instruction or free-running caller is enabled.** This
preserves debug/interrupt/exit/timer boundaries while the new memory/flag/
branch contracts await actual differential tests. Source preparation of the
larger capsule is not a block-execution result or performance candidate.
A useful block caller requires separate review of its instruction budget,
async exits, interruption between steps, protected breakpoints, context and
invalidation, followed by actual synthetic and guest lifecycle evidence.

Before any build/run: freeze exact source/library hashes and use a separately
admitted finite j1 build. First repeat the historical eight-state OFF/ON and
stock witness-negative, then new exact load/ALU/flags/branch cases with
witness-required negatives. Compare every integer register and CPSR, require
real TCG permission/translation/alignment/prefetch faults with no alternate
witness, and preserve all failed attempts. No iOS/Android/real-board operation
or speed measurement is authorized by this source change.
