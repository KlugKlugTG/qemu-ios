 * One jump cache per guest address space (e.g. an ARM ASID), so that a
 * context switch, which must flush the softmmu TLB, can switch caches
 * instead of emptying the only one. A guest switching processes hundreds
 * of times a second otherwise sends every indirect branch after each
 * switch to the QHT; for an iOS 3 guest that was ~80% of all jump-cache
 * clears and ~15-20% of host CPU time.
 *
 * Entries map a virtual PC to a TB, so a cache is valid only for its own
 * address space, and only until a mapping in it changes. Every operation
 * that may change mappings still clears: a page flush clears that page in
 * every cache, and a full flush (TLBI ALL/ASID, tb_flush, reset, CF_PCREL
 * invalidation) bumps @epoch, empties the current cache now and the
 * others when they are next switched to. Like the TLB, this relies on the
 * guest invalidating an ASID before reusing it.
 *
 * cpu->tb_jmp_cache always points at the current member. Only the owning
 * vCPU switches; other threads use the pointer only to reach the bank.
