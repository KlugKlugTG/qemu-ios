/*
 * One jump cache per guest address space (an ARM ASID), so that a context
 * switch, which must flush the softmmu TLB, can switch caches instead of
 * emptying the only one. A guest switching processes hundreds of times a
 * second otherwise sends every indirect branch after each switch to the QHT.
 *
 * Entries map a virtual PC to a TB, so a cache is valid only for its own
 * address space, and only until a mapping in it changes. Every operation
 * that may change mappings still clears: a page flush clears that page in
 * every cache, and a full flush (TLBIALL, tb_flush, reset, a CF_PCREL
 * invalidation) bumps @epoch, empties the current cache now and the others
 * when they are next switched to. Like the TLB, this relies on the guest
 * invalidating an ASID (or the page, or everything) before reusing it.
 *
 * cpu->tb_jmp_cache always points at the current member. Only the owning
 * vCPU switches; other threads use the pointer only to reach the bank, and
 * a stale entry they miss is harmless: an invalidated TB has CF_INVALID in
 * its cflags, so tb_lookup never matches it.
