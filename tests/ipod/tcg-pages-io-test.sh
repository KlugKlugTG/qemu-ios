# The iPod's translations: 4K pages, and a polled device read that ends its block instead of rewinding it.
#
# The ARM1176 can't map a page under 4K (VMSAv6 has no tiny pages), so the iPod machine runs on 4K target pages: a
# block may run on past a 1K boundary, and a branch within 4K chains. And an MMIO load must be a block's last insn;
# one found mid-block is rewound (cpu_io_recompile) and run alone, which a device polled in a loop (the kernel's
# timebase read) paid on every pass until the block is retranslated to end at the load.
#
# A bare-metal program as the iPod's bootrom (staged at 0, MMU off) runs nine NOPs across 0x400, then reads CHIPID
# a thousand times mid-block, and spins. Under -d exec, no block may start at 0x400 (the page boundary of a 1K page)
# and at most a few loads may be rewound. QEMU= selects the binary (default build/qemu-system-arm).
