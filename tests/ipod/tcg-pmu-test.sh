# The Cortex-A8's PMU with its EL-change hooks run without the BQL.
#
# The hooks bring the counters up to date at every exception entry and return; they now run on the vCPU without the
# BQL, and the counters' overflow timer hands its update to the vCPU (async_run_on_cpu) instead of making it from the
# main loop. tests/ipod/tcg-pmu.S, run as the iPad's bootrom (tests/ipod/bare-rom.sh), checks that the cycle counter
# grows across a thousand svc and movs pc, lr round trips and that an overflow 4096 cycles out reaches PMOVSR while
# the program only polls it. QEMU= selects the binary (default build/qemu-system-arm).
