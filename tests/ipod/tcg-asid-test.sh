# ASID switches, TLB maintenance and rewritten code on the ARM1176 and Cortex-A8 boards.
#
# TCG keeps a TB jump cache per ASID and the kernel's global TLB entries across an ASID switch, as the hardware's
# tagged TLB does. Both are only right if every way a guest changes or invalidates a mapping still reaches them:
# non-global kernel-mode pages must go at a switch (one by one, or all past 32), a page invalidated while another ASID
# runs must leave that ASID's jump cache, as must a TLBIASID or TLBIALL, a reused cache must start empty, and code
# rewritten through another mapping (a JIT) must be seen in every address space.
#
# tests/ipod/tcg-asid.S does each of these on the iPod touch 2G (ARM1176, RAM at 0x08000000) and the iPad
# (Cortex-A8, RAM at 0x40000000), run as the bootrom (tests/ipod/bare-rom.sh); both boards use 4K target pages, as
# the kept-entry path needs. QEMU= selects the binary (default build/qemu-system-arm).
