# Native drawable initialization diagnostics

An Android platform GLES1 driver has returned the renderer's generic `FBO
incomplete` message during a real guest boot. That message follows successful
EGL context creation and required OES framebuffer capability validation. The
following `REFUSED host:no-context` is the renderer's latched initialization
failure; it does not establish failed EGL creation or a guest reboot.

The Android-native failure diagnostic retains the first setup error/stage,
color-only and final framebuffer status, actual dimensions/object names/API,
renderer/version and packed-depth/NPOT extension flags. It preserves GL errors
using the existing per-context store. It has no per-draw logging or changed
fallback policy. Mac/CGL/EAGL diagnostic behavior remains unchanged.

`egl-drawable-init.c` compiles the production EGL and native adapters. Its
default recipe is the real n72 drawable's320x480 RGBA/unsigned-byte texture,
LINEAR filtering, default REPEAT wrapping, private high object names and packed
depth24/stencil8 attached to both points. Earlier32x32 triangle probes did not
cover that NPOT allocation. Each invocation has a20-second alarm and retains
the first failing operation. A full PASS requires actual green depth/stencil
writes followed by blue depth/stencil equality readback, not a COMPLETE enum.

Build this one probe with the same NDK/link flags as `check.sh`; it depends on
`gles-host-egl.c.inc`, `gles-host-native.c.inc`, `gles-host-rectangle.c.inc`,
`gles-host-driver.c.inc` and `gles-host-driver-entries.c.inc`. Link only public
EGL/GLESv2/GLESv1_CM/dl/libc and use16KiB ELF alignment. Preserve source/binary
hashes, stdout/stderr, real exit and actual driver/context identity per attempt.
No host, shell or run-as probe by itself qualifies an application guest.

Run the default first, then these one-factor comparisons using the SAME binary:

| Arguments | Isolated difference |
|---|---|
| none | Production320x480 recipe |
| `--size=32x32` | POT allocation matching earlier probes |
| `--generated` | glGen names instead of first-bind private names |
| `--clamp` | CLAMP_TO_EDGE for both private texture wrap axes |
| `--separate` | Separate depth16 and stencil8 renderbuffers |

The probe reports UID/eUID, SELinux context, actual vendor GL/EGL mappings,
renderer/version/extensions and each operation's real GL error. A run-as UID
match alone does not prove the same application namespace/driver selection;
compare those receipts with the unchanged real app. Preserve denied execution
or differing identity as limitations. The probe does not select any production
format, silently retry or downgrade guest capabilities.

`DEPTH24_STENCIL8` is supplied by the optional
[OES packed-depth/stencil extension](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/OES/OES_packed_depth_stencil.txt).
[OES framebuffer objects](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/OES/OES_framebuffer_object.txt)
alone do not guarantee that format. GLES1 NPOT image allocation also needs
appropriate extension support; limited NPOT texturing restricts wrapping/filtering.
However, texture sampling completeness and framebuffer attachment completeness
are distinct. The [EXT framebuffer attachment rules inherited by OES](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_framebuffer_object.txt)
do not require general texture sampling completeness. Therefore a wrap-mode
comparison is diagnostic, not proof that the original framebuffer violated a
specification. Likewise, no generated-name workaround is justified solely by
the old generic failure. The actual operation/error/status/capabilities must
select the next change.

The default and comparisons are source/build diagnostics until actually run.
Guest rendering, visible changing scenes, lifecycle and normal Stop remain
independent acceptance gates.
